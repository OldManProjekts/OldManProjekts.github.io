Hey there!  We are a couple of soon to be empty nesters trying to figure out what comes next.

Originally meeting in Tampa FL we have moved the family to both Europe and Asia living, working, and enjoying life as a family.
We moved back to the US to have the boys finish school and move on to their own futures.

With that chapter of our lives coming to an a close we began to wonder what we wanted to do next.
